# VBA_Challenge
## Overview of the Project  <br />
### Background <br />
Steve's parents would like to do some investment and asking Steve to help them for advise. They have some idea on what stock they would like to invest in but also lack of understanding on picking the stock. Steve is looking to do some analysis that will help them make a better decision. 
### Purpose <br />
    This VBA analysis has been performed to identify how stocks have performed in the years of 2017 and 2018 and if the stock is worth investing into based on the data and completed analysis
## Results <br />
  Significant improvement of runtime is seen between runtime of original and refactored
	The run time for original code went over 1 second of time for both years. As the code ran multiple times, the run time was reduced. Comparatively, the runtime for refactored code was significantly less from beginning.
## Summary <br />
	Refactoring the code makes the code easier to maintain, less complex and easily understandable. Once the code is written, there is no guarantee on how much time it will take to refactor the code and even after the refactoring the code there is no certaintly that it will perform the same operation with less runtime 
	After refactoring the VBA Challenge code, the runtime was reduced but it took me a while to understand the concepts and apply it. I had to take help from the TA to make the code work. In the refactored code, there are certainly less operation as we are not looping through all the rows to complete the operation.
